# BikeLockDecoding

This project will help me understand more about Java streams, Java IO, and retrieving HTML from a URL using Java.

I have a bike lock made by the company WordLock. They make bicycle combination locks that use letters instead of numbers. My specific version has 4 rings of 10 random letters each. One problem exists that prevents me from using this lock. I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE CODE!! I remember this lock came with an easy to remember 4 letter word that a 5 year old could remember, but somehow it escapes me. I could try entering all of the combinations some day to see if I can crack it, but I would have to try 10,000 combinations. I do not feel like doing that. Because there is this awesome thing called the computer that does math fast, I want to build an aplication that gives me all the possible four letter permutations that I can make with this lock, and see which ones are actually words, and then see if any of these words jog my memory.
